My inspiration for this project came from Grant Collins' Video "Create an Advanced Keylogger in Python - Crash Course". 
I appreciated that in the beginning of his video he encouraged his audience to try to make their own program and only use his project as ideas. 
I barely watched the video. 
In the video's description he gave a link to download a PDF that provided his own resources and advice in bullet-points. 
His video was simply inspiration. 
I did a lot of my own research to make my own final tool, which is very different than his.
