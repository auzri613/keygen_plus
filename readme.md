There are the included files:
In the "Script" folder:
1) "Program_Non-encrypted.py" is my original script.
2) "Encrypt_Program.py" is my original script with an function that encrypts the whole script.
-- The encryption is saved into "Encrypted_Program.txt"
-- Neither "Encrypt_Program.py" nor "Program_Non-encrypted.py" are needed to actually run the program.
In the main directory:
3) "Encrypted_Program.txt" is the encryption of the script. Don't modify it at all!
4) "Run_Encrypted_Program.py" decrypts the encryption and then runs the program.
5) "crypt.key" is the key used to encrypt/decrypt the log files and screenshots. 
6) "decrypter.pyw" is the script needed to decrypt the log files and screenshots.
7) "key_generator.pyw" just creates a new key stored in "crypt.key". You may change it before running the program and after running decrypter.pyw, but don't change it in the middle!

This program is created for educational purposes only!
