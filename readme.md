There are the included files: 

In the "Script" folder: 
1) "Program_Non-encrypted.py" is my original script. 
2) "Encrypt_Program.py" is my original script with an function that encrypts the whole script. 
- The encryption is saved into "Encrypted_Program.txt", which is in the main directory.
- Neither "Encrypt_Program.py" nor "Program_Non-encrypted.py" are needed to actually run the program. 

In the main directory: 
1) "Encrypted_Program.txt" is the encryption of the script. Don't modify it at all! 
2) "Run_Encrypted_Program.py" decrypts the encryption and then runs the program. 
3) "crypt.key" is the key used to encrypt/decrypt the log files and screenshots. 
4) "decrypter.pyw" is the script needed to decrypt the log files and screenshots. 
5) "key_generator.pyw" just creates a new key stored in "crypt.key". You may change it before running the program and after running decrypter.pyw, but don't change it in the middle!
