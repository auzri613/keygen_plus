There are a few files here:
1) "Program_Non-encrypted.py" is my original script.
2) "Encrypt_Program.py" is my original script with an function that encrypts the whole script.
-- The encryption is saved into "Encrypted_Program.txt"
-- Neither "Encrypt_Program.py" nor "Program_Non-encrypted.py" are needed to actually run the program.
3) "Encrypted_Program.txt" is the encryption of the script. 
4) "Run_Encrypted_Program.py" decrypts the encryption and then runs the program.
5) "key_generator.pyw" just creates a new key stored in "crypt.key"
6) "crypt.key" is the key used to encrypt/decrypt the log files and screenshots
7) "decrypter.pyw" is the script needed to decrypt the log files and screenshots.

I figured out how to run an encrypted script from the following forum:
